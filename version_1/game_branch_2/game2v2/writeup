idea: 

clear main loop of code. 

start going through old code and understand it. 

if you can understand it (at least basically) continue on.

whatever you cant, you should re-implement.  

there were times where you wanted to do the code a certain way and couldn't do it that way. 
You instead found some other way to do it that...you didn't like structurally speaking...but
that worked. Improve it if you can. If you can't...at least by trying you'll learn about it. 


grep -Ril "text-to-find-here" /


grep -Ril "var printWords" ~/Desktop/java_script_video_game1/game2v2

game0.html -> write_to_screenV2.js -> mainLoop.js and prints the stuff out 

remove the "that"'s whenever possible. figure out when they are and are not needed. 

need to figure out why I cant define ctx the way that I want to. 

person_set_1


grep -Ril "person_set_1" ~/Desktop/java_script_video_game1/game2v2

goal: go through genObject and square_gen_object


want to clean up all the code in this project. First go over code...then add the circle stuff (so that you can,
in the future, do things like direct the path that you want the characters to take) and then proceed from there. 

see if you can break up genObject and square_gen_obj files a bit. 

tomorrow...go through gen_obj. make an instance...walk through how it works...and make whatever corrections
make sense.
