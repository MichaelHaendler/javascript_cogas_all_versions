idea: 

clear main loop of code. 

start going through old code and understand it. 

if you can understand it (at least basically) continue on.

whatever you cant, you should re-implement.  

there were times where you wanted to do the code a certain way and couldn't do it that way. 
You instead found some other way to do it that...you didn't like structurally speaking...but
that worked. Improve it if you can. If you can't...at least by trying you'll learn about it.
